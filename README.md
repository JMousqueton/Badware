> Ransomware Demonstration for Customer Experience Center

## Description

Quick & Dirty ransomware written in Powershell for the purpose of demonstrations at Customer Experience Center.

This Powershell ransomware encrypts files using an X.509 public key certificate generated on the host :) 

By Default the ransomware will cenrypt files in the C:\Data folder and save the X.509 public key certificate which is auto-generated in C:\YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM folder

This "ransomware" was inspired by [Phirautee](https://github.com/Viralmaniar/Phirautee)
